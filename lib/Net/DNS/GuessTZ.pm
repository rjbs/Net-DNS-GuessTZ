=head1 NAME

Net::DNS::GuessTZ - guess the time zone of a host

=head1 VERSION

version 0.002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::DNS::GuessTZ qw(tz_from_host);

  my $tz = tz_from_host('cr.yp.to');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Brazenly stolen from L<Plagger::Plugin::Filter::GuessTimeZoneByDomain>, this
module makes an effort to guess an appropriate time zone for a given host.  It
will look up the location of the IP addresses owner and it will also consider
the country code top-level domain, if the host is under one.

=head1 CAVEATS

This is fine if you don't really care too much about being correct.  It's
probably better than just always assuming local time.

Still, if possible, ask the user for his time zone when you can!

=head1 METHODS

=cut

use DateTime::TimeZone 0.51;
use List::Util ();

use Sub::Exporter::Util;
use Sub::Exporter -setup => {
  exports => [ tz_from_host => Sub::Exporter::Util::curry_method ],
};

my $ICF;
sub _icf {
  $ICF ||= do {
    require IP::Country::Fast;
    IP::Country::Fast->new;
  };
}

sub _all_tz_from_cctld {
  my ($self, $host) = @_;
  return unless my ($cctld) = $host =~ /\.(\w{2})\z/;
  DateTime::TimeZone->names_in_country($cctld);
}

sub _all_tz_from_ip {
  my ($self, $host) = @_;
  return unless my $cc = $self->_icf->inet_atocc($host);
  my @names = DateTime::TimeZone->names_in_country($cc);
}

=head2 tz_from_host

  my $tz_name = Net::DNS::GuessTZ->tz_from_host($hostname, %arg);

This routine returns a guess at the given host's time zone, or false if no
guess can be made.

Valid arguments are:

  priority   - which method to give priority to: "cc" or "ip"; default: ip
  ip_country - whether to check the IP address's owner with IP::Country;
               defaults to true

Unlike the Plagger plugin, this routine will gladly make a guess when the
country it finds has more than three time zones.

  my @names = $self->_all_tz_from_cctld($host);
  $result{cc} = $names[0] if @names; # and @names <= 3;

    my @names = $self->_all_tz_from_ip($host);
    $result{ip} = $names[0] if @names; # if @names <= 3;
